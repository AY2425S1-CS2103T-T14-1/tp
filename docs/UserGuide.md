   * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd client shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all clients.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.


6. If you are a beginner, we recommend that you check out the [Command Structure](#4-command-structure) section to find out more about command syntax. Otherwise, you may also choose to skip and proceed directly to the [Command](#5-commands-overview) section for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. Command Structure

Understanding the structure of Prudyâ€™s commands will allow you to use the application more effectively. Each command in Prudy consists of **Commands**, **Flags**, and **Arguments**. This section explains each of these components and how they work together to execute actions in Prudy.

### 4.1 Overview

Prudy commands are structured to be straightforward and efficient, consisting of three parts:
1. **Command**: The main action, such as `add` or `delete`.
2. **Flags**: Short prefixes that define specific data fields, like `n/` for name or `p/` for phone.
3. **Arguments**: The actual values provided for each flag, such as a clientâ€™s name or email.

Hereâ€™s an example to demonstrate the structure:
```shell
add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/123 Elm St
````
In this command:

- **Command**: `add` instructs Prudy to add a new client.
- **Flags**: `n/`, `p/`, and `e/` specify the data fields (name, phone, email).
- **Arguments**: `John Doe`, `98765432`, `johnd@example.com` are the values for each flag.

### 4.2 Commands

Commands represent the **primary actions** Prudy will perform. Each command initiates a specific function within the app. Here are the main commands:

| Command       | Description                                                         |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `add`         | Adds a new client.                                                  |
| `edit`        | Modifies an existing clientâ€™s details.                              |
| `delete`      | Removes a client from Prudy.                                        |
| `list`        | Lists all clients stored in Prudy.                                  |
| `find-client` | Searches clients based on specified criteria.                       |
| `clear`       | Deletes all client data, resetting Prudy.                           |
| `exit`        | Closes the Prudy application.                                       |

These are just some of the basic commands, please refer to [Commands Overview](#5-commands-overview) for a comprehensive list of Prudy's features.

### 4.3 Flags

**Flags** are used within commands to define **specific types of data** that Prudy will handle. They allow you to quickly indicate what information youâ€™re providing. Below is a list of flags you can use:

| Flag  | Data Type               |
|-------|-------------------------|
| `n/`  | Name                    |
| `p/`  | Phone                   |
| `e/`  | Email                   |
| `a/`  | Address                 |
| `t/`  | Tags                    |
| `pt/` | Policy Type             |
| `pa/` | Policy Premium Amount   |
| `ca/` | Policy Coverage Amount  |
| `ed/` | Policy Expiry Date      |
| `s/`  | Claim Status            |
| `d/`  | Claim Description       |
| `c/`  | Claim Index             |


ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Flags are generally derived from the first letter of the data type, making them easy to remember.

### 4.4 Arguments

**Arguments** are the **values provided for each flag** in a command. They must meet **certain requirements** to be valid. Hereâ€™s a list of common arguments in Prudy and their expected formats:

| Flag  | Expected Argument         | Description                      | Requirements                                            |

| `s/`  | Claim Status               | Status of the claim              | Predefined statuses (e.g., pending, approved, rejected) |
| `d/`  | Claim Description          | Description of the claim         | Any alphanumeric and symbol                             |
| `c/`  | Claim Index                | Claim index for reference        | Positive integer, used for identifying claims           |


In Prudy, arguments ensure that the command functions as expected. Without correct arguments, Prudy may display an error message indicating the input is invalid.

<box type="info" seamless>
Info: In the following commands section below, arguments and flags enclosed in square brackets <code>[]</code> are optional. For example, in the command <code>add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]â€¦â€‹</code>, the <code>[t/TAG]</code> part is optional and can be omitted if not needed.
</box>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 5. Commands Overview

This section will guide you on the commands available and how to use them correctly to optimise your workflow. If you have trouble understanding the command syntax, we highly recommend that you refer back to [Command Structure](#4-command-structure) as  basic knowledge of the command structure will give you a better understanding of our commands.

Prudy uses a command-line interface with **four primary categories** of commands to manage various aspects of **client data, policies**, and **claims**. Each command type serves a distinct purpose:

1. **General Commands**: Used for basic navigation, help, saving, and exiting the program.
2. **Client Management Commands**: Commands to add, edit, delete, and filter client information.
3. **Policy Management Commands**: Commands to manage policies for each client, including adding, editing, and deleting policies.
4. **Claims Management Commands**: Commands for managing client claims (available in future updates).

---

### 5.1 General Commands

These commands help with **general navigation**, displaying help information, saving data, and exiting the program.

<box type="info" seamless>
<span class="font-weight-bold">Note:</span> Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as <code>help</code>, <code>list</code>, <code>exit</code>, and <code>clear</code>) will be ignored.
e.g., if the command specifies <code>help 123</code>, it will be interpreted as <code>help</code>.
</box>


### 5.1.1 Viewing help : `help`
Shows a message explaining how to **access the help page**.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`

### 5.1.2 Clearing All Entries: `clear`
**Clears all entries** from Prudy, resetting the data.

Format: `clear`

<box type=warning seamless>
Warning: This action is destructive and irreversible.
</box>

### 5.1.3 Exiting the Program: `exit`
**Exits** the program.

Format: `exit`

### 5.1.4 Saving the Data
Prudy **automatically saves data** to the hard disk after every command that modifies the data. Manual saving is **not required**.

### 5.1.5 Editing the Data File
Prudy data is **automatically saved** as a JSON file at `[JAR file location]/data/prudy.json`. Advanced users may edit this file directly to update the data.

<box type="warning" seamless>
Caution:
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Prudy will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>

Furthermore, certain edits can cause Prudy to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

---

### 5.2 Client Management Commands

**Client management commands** allow you to add, edit, delete, and filter client data.

### 5.2.1 Adding a Client: `add`

Adds a **new client** to Prudy.  

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]â€¦â€‹`


ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: A client can have any number of tags (including 0).


Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 t/criminal`

### 5.2.2 Listing All Clients: `list`
Shows a **list of all clients** in Prudy.

Format: `list`

### 5.2.3 Filtering Clients: `find-client`
**Filters clients** based on the specified parameters.

Format: `find-client [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [pt/POLICY_TYPE]â€¦`

Details:
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g., `hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g., `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only full words will be matched e.g., `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Clients matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
  e.g., `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
* Only clients that match all parameters specified will be returned.
  e.g., `n/han pt/life` will return only clients that has `han` in his name and has a Life policy.

  <box type="info" seamless>
  Info: Each parameter must have a valid input (e.g., PHONE must be a 3-15 digits long, POLICY_TYPE must be a valid policy type - Life, Education or Health).
  </box>

Examples:
* `find n/John` returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find n/alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`<br>
  ![result for 'find n/alex david'](images/findAlexDavidResult.png)

  <box type=warning seamless>
  Important: For the next few commands, an INDEX parameter is required. This INDEX is based on the current list of clients shown in Prudy.
               This means that if Prudy has 2 clients: <code>Alex</code> and <code>Bernice</code> given in that order, and you did <code>find-client n/bernice</code> to filter out <code>Alex</code>. An INDEX of <code>1</code> will refer to <code>Bernice</code> instead of <code>Alex</code>.
  </box>

### 5.2.4 Editing a Clientâ€™s Details: `edit`
**Edits an existing client** in Prudy. **Does not edit his/her policies**. See [editing a policy](#5-3-3-editing-a-policy-edit-policy) for more info on the command.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]â€¦â€‹`

* Edits the client at the specified `INDEX`.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the client will be removed i.e. adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the client's tags by typing `t/` without
  specifying any tags after it.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` Edits the phone number and email address of the 1st client to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the 2nd client to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

### 5.2.5 Deleting a Client: `delete`
**Deletes a specified client** at the specified `INDEX`.

### 5.3 Policy Management Commands

**Policy management commands** allow you to add, edit, and delete policies associated with each client.

### 5.3.1 Adding a Policy: `add-policy`
**Adds a policy** to the client at the specified `INDEX`.

Format: `add-policy INDEX pt/POLICY_TYPE [pa/PREMIUM_AMOUNT] [ca/COVERAGE_AMOUNT] [ed/EXPIRY_DATE]`

Details:
* `POLICY_TYPE` is case-insensitive and can be either `life`, `health`, or `education`.
* `PREMIUM_AMOUNT` and `COVERAGE_AMOUNT` must be non-negative numerals.
* `EXPIRY_DATE` format is `MM/dd/yyyy`.
* This command will create a policy with default values for unspecified parameters.
e.g., `pt/life ca/100 ed/12/09/2024` will create a Life policy with default premiums.

  <box type=info seamless>
  Info: This command will not allow you to add a policy to the client if he/she already has a policy of similar type.
  </box>

Examples:
* `add-policy 1 pt/life` Adds a Life policy with default values to the 1st client.
* `add-policy 2 pt/education pa/100.00 ed/08/24/2024` Adds an Education policy with default coverage, a premium of $100.00 and an expiry date of 08/24/2024.

### 5.3.2 Deleting a Policy: `delete-policy`

## 6. FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Prudy home folder.

## 7. Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
