## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete-client 1`.

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ClientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Client` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete-client 1")` API call as an example.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteClientSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete-client 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteClientCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `PrudyParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteClientCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteClientCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a client).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `PrudyParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddClientCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddClientCommand`) which the `PrudyParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddClientCommandParser`, `DeleteClientCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores Prudy's data i.e., all `Client` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueClientList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Client` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Client>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `Prudy`, which `Client` references. This allows `Prudy` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Client` needing their own `Tag` objects. (Note that the details of PolicySet has been omitted from this diagram as they are not relevant)<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2425S1-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both Prudy's data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `PrudyStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedPrudy`. It extends `Prudy` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `prudyStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedPrudy#commit()` — Saves the current Prudy state in its history.
* `VersionedPrudy#undo()` — Restores the previous Prudy state from its history.
* `VersionedPrudy#redo()` — Restores a previously undone Prudy state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitPrudy()`, `Model#undoPrudy()` and `Model#redoPrudy()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedPrudy` will be initialized with the initial Prudy state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single Prudy state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete-client 5` command to delete the 5th client in Prudy. The `delete-client` command calls `Model#commitPrudy()`, causing the modified state of Prudy after the `delete-client 5` command executes to be saved in the `prudyStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted Prudy state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add-client n/David …​` to add a new client. The `add-client` command also calls `Model#commitPrudy()`, causing another modified Prudy state to be saved into the `prudyStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitPrudy()`, so the Prudy state will not be saved into the `prudyStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the client was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoPrudy()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous Prudy state, and restores Prudy to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial Prudy state, then there are no previous Prudy states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoPrudy()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoPrudy()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores Prudy to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `prudyStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest Prudy state, then there are no undone Prudy states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoPrudy()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list-client`. Commands that do not modify Prudy, such as `list-client`, will usually not call `Model#commitPrudy()`, `Model#undoPrudy()` or `Model#redoPrudy()`. Thus, the `prudyStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitPrudy()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `prudyStateList`, all Prudy states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add-client n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves entire Prudy.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete-client`, just save the client being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

---

### Client Management

#### Deleting a Client

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure there are multiple clients listed using `list-client`.
2. **Test Case**: `delete-client 1`
    - **Expected**: Deletes the first client in the list. The status message displays details of the deletion, and the timestamp updates.
3. **Test Case**: `delete-client 0`
    - **Expected**: No client is deleted. An error message is shown, and the status bar remains unchanged.
4. **Incorrect Commands**:
    - `delete-client` (no index specified)
    - `delete-client x` (where `x` is greater than the number of clients)
    - **Expected**: An error message for invalid input or index.

---

### Policy and Claim Management

#### Listing Policies

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure `list-client` is used to verify that the client has policies.
2. **Test Case**: `list-policies 1`
    - **Expected**: Lists all policies for the first client. If there are no policies, an appropriate message is displayed.

---

### Claim Management

#### Listing Claims

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure policies with claims are present by using `list-client` and `list-policies`.
2. **Test Case**: `list-claims 1 pt/health`
    - **Expected**: Lists all claims under the health policy for the first client. If no claims are found, an appropriate message is shown.
3. **Invalid Policy Type**: `list-claims 2 pt/lifee`
    - **Expected**: An error indicating an invalid policy type, not a generic format error.

#### Adding a Claim

1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure there is a valid policy for the client using `list-policies`.
2. **Test Case**: `add-claim 1 pt/health s/PENDING d/Medical Expenses`
    - **Expected**: Adds a new claim to the health policy. Success message is displayed.
3. **Invalid Inputs**: Test with incorrect claim statuses, policy types, or invalid claim descriptions.
    - **Expected**: Validation error messages are displayed.

---

### Data Persistence

#### Saving Data

1. **Step**: Perform various add/delete operations on clients or policies.
2. **Expected**: Data should save automatically and persist when the application is closed and reopened.

---

### Handling Missing/Corrupted Data Files

1. **Simulating Missing Data File**:
    - **Step**: Navigate to the app's data directory and remove the data file.
    - **Step**: Re-launch the app.
    - **Expected**: The app should load with default data and display a warning about missing data.

2. **Simulating Corrupted Data File**:
    - **Step**: Open the data file and corrupt the contents (e.g., remove part of the JSON structure).
    - **Step**: Re-launch the app.
    - **Expected**: The app should show an error message and initialize with default data.

---

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

1. **Extreme Input Values**:
    - **Test Case**: Enter long strings or special characters in client or claim fields.
    - **Expected**: Proper validation errors and handling without app crashes.
2. **Invalid Command Inputs**:
    - **Test Case**: Commands like `add-client` with missing parameters.
    - **Expected**: Informative error messages are displayed.

---

### Exploratory Testing Tips

- Try boundary values for indices and numeric inputs.
- Ensure the app remains responsive when handling multiple sequential commands.
- Check how the app handles rapid commands and actions in succession.
